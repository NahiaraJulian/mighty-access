                    <p>
                        The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
                        team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                        this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                        background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
